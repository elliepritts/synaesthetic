            <p>A train rushes past you in the subway. Birds chirp off in the distance. Someone clears their throat in line at the coffeeshop. Sound is everywhere&mdash;we are surrounded by it each and every waking moment, but not all of us experience sound in the same way. Let me show you how I experience sound. Close your eyes for thirty seconds. Snap your fingers. Do you see what I see?</p>
            <p>I see the color blue.</p>
            <p>Hear a frequency, see a color. Simple as that. Many creative types have it. Musicians. Mathematicians. Photographers.</p>
            <p>As a child, I never talked about synesthesia, because I thought everyone else on the playground had it. When I realized that wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the case, I kept my gift a secret. I was afraid of sounding like a crazy person. And even now, in my adult life, I&rsquo;m slow to bring up the subject.</p>
            <p>So I created Synæsthetic, an interactive experience pairing color and frequency. My mind, on your screen. Each note has a color, strike a chord and progress to the next level.</p>
            <p>My name is Ellie Pritts, and I&rsquo;m a professional photographer. For years, I&rsquo;ve shown the world my life through a camera lens. But with Synæsthetic, I&rsquo;m showing you the world through my eyes.</p>
            <p>Play Synæsthetic. See what I see.</p>
